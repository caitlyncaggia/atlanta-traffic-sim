Project 2, Group 57: Caitlyn Caggia, Blaine Costello, Lakshmi Raju

The code is written in Python 3.6, that will be needed to run the code.

Each model is in their own folder:
1) Event Oriented: To run, python 3.6 is needed, as well as numpy, math, and random.
2) Cellular Automata: To run, python 3.6 is needed, as well as numpy, time, and random. To run, simply change the time steps in the third to last line and run.
3) Activity Scanning: To run, python 3.7 is needed (compatible with 3.6) as well as numpy and time.
